No tax will be payable on exports of goods or services, however credit of input tax credit will be available and same will be available as refund to the exporters. 	vastuon ya sevaon ke niryaat par koee kar dey nahin hoga, haalaanki inaput taiks kredit ka kredit upalabdh hoga aur yah niryaatakon ko riphand ke roop mein upalabdh hoga.
The Exporter will have an option to either pay tax on the output and claim refund of IGST or export under Bond without payment of IGST and claim refund of Input Tax Credit	eksaportar ke paas igst ke bhugataan ke bina bond ke tahat igst ya eksaport ke aautaput aur klem riphand par kar ka bhugataan karane ka vikalp hoga aur inaput taiks kredit ka riphand klem karega
GST consumes more than a dozen taxes, thus making it hassle free and efficient.	jeeesatee ek darjan se adhik karon ka upabhog karata hai, is prakaar yah pareshaanee mukt aur kushal banaata hai.
Elimination of Cascading Effect of Taxes,Seamless flow of Input Tax Credit,Common Market,Bett,Technology led Law er Days for Under Developed States ,	karon ke kaiskeding prabhaav ka unmoolan, inaput taiks kredit ka nirbaadh pravaah, koman maarket, bet, praudyogikee ke tahat vikasit raajyon ke lie kaanoon er dinon ka netrtv kiya,
benefits forgovernment  include simple and easy to administer, better control on leakage,  higher revenue efficiency, etc	maaphee ke laabh mein saral aur aasaan prashaasan, risaav par behatar niyantran, uchch raajasv dakshata aadi shaamil hain
The Goods and Services Tax would benefit the industry most. 	guds end sarvisej taiks se indastree ko sabase jyaada phaayada hoga.
That is why the industry was demanding it for a long time. 	yahee vajah hai ki indastree lambe samay se isakee maang kar rahee thee.
A study tells that Because of the GST, the industry would grow rapidly.	ek adhyayan bataata hai ki jeeesatee kee vajah se udyog tejee se badhega.
Benefits of GST for consumers are :- Reduction in price of goods and services, Uniform prices throughout the country, Trust in Simpler Tax System and Better accessibility of goods and services	upabhoktaon ke lie jeeesatee ke laabh hain: - vastuon aur sevaon kee keemat mein kamee, poore desh mein samaan mooly, saral taiks pranaalee mein vishvaas aur vastuon aur sevaon kee behatar pahunch.
GST being a consumption based, destination based tax, it will provide a huge boost to consumption heavy states, who can now utilize the revenue jump to focus on industrialization and manufacturing.	jeeesatee ek upabhog aadhaarit, gantavy aadhaarit kar hai, yah upabhog karane vaale bhaaree raajyon ko bhaaree badhaava dega, jo ab raajasv kood ka upayog audyogikeekaran aur vinirmaan par dhyaan kendrit karane ke lie kar sakate hain.
Will not be required to use HSN codes	echesen kod ka upayog karane kee aavashyakata nahin hogee
Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. 	bhaarat mein apratyaksh kar sudhaaron ke kshetr mein gst ka parichay ek bahut mahatvapoorn kadam hoga.
By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market.	kendr aur raajy karon kee ek badee sankhya ko ek kar mein samaahit karake aur poorv-charan karon ke set-oph kee anumati dekar, yah kaiskeding ke bure prabhaavon ko kam karega aur ek saamaany raashtreey baajaar ke lie maarg prashast karega.
GST will effectively dissolve state boundaries, as the same tax rate prevails across the entire country. 	jeeesatee prabhaavee roop se raajy kee seemaon ko bhang kar dega, kyonki poore desh mein ek hee kar dar prabal hai.
Also the removal of Central Sales Tax and the removal of VAT will mean that the entire country will become a level playing ground for all businesses.	saath hee kendreey bikree kar ko hataane aur vait ko hataane ka matalab hoga ki poora desh sabhee vyavasaayon ke lie ek star ka khel ban jaega.
Tax payers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year up to Rs.20 lakhs and Rs.10 Lakhs for NE and special category states would be exempt from tax. 	enee aur vishesh shrenee ke raajyon ke lie ek vitteey varsh mein 20 laakh rupaye aur kul laakh rupaye tak ke kul kaarobaar vaale karadaataon ko kar se chhoot dee jaegee.
Further, a person whose aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is less than Rs.75 Lakhs can opt for a simplified composition scheme where tax will payable at a concessional rate on the turnover in a state.	isake alaava, ek vyakti jisaka poorvavartee vitteey varsh mein kul kaarobaar ru .75 laakh se kam hai, ek saraleekrt rachana yojana ka vikalp chun sakata hai, jahaan raajy mein tarnovar par riyaayatee dar par kar dey hoga.
