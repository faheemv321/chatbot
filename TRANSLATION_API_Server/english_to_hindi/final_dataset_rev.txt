guds end sarvisej taiks se indastree ko sabase jyaada phaayada hoga.	The Goods and Services Tax would benefit the industry most. 
yahee vajah hai ki indastree lambe samay se isakee maang kar rahee thee.	That is why the industry was demanding it for a long time. 
ek adhyayan bataata hai ki jeeesatee kee vajah se udyog tejee se badhega.	A study tells that Because of the GST, the industry would grow rapidly.
upabhoktaon ke lie jeeesatee ke laabh hain: - vastuon aur sevaon kee keemat mein kamee, poore desh mein samaan mooly, saral taiks pranaalee mein vishvaas aur vastuon aur sevaon kee behatar pahunch.	Benefits of GST for consumers are :- Reduction in price of goods and services, Uniform prices throughout the country, Trust in Simpler Tax System and Better accessibility of goods and services
jeeesatee ek upabhog aadhaarit, gantavy aadhaarit kar hai, yah upabhog karane vaale bhaaree raajyon ko bhaaree badhaava dega, jo ab raajasv kood ka upayog audyogikeekaran aur vinirmaan par dhyaan kendrit karane ke lie kar sakate hain.	GST being a consumption based, destination based tax, it will provide a huge boost to consumption heavy states, who can now utilize the revenue jump to focus on industrialization and manufacturing.

bhaarat mein apratyaksh kar sudhaaron ke kshetr mein gst ka parichay ek bahut mahatvapoorn kadam hoga.	Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. 
kendr aur raajy karon kee ek badee sankhya ko ek kar mein samaahit karake aur poorv-charan karon ke set-oph kee anumati dekar, yah kaiskeding ke bure prabhaavon ko kam karega aur ek saamaany raashtreey baajaar ke lie maarg prashast karega.	By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market.
jeeesatee prabhaavee roop se raajy kee seemaon ko bhang kar dega, kyonki poore desh mein ek hee kar dar prabal hai.	GST will effectively dissolve state boundaries, as the same tax rate prevails across the entire country. 
saath hee kendreey bikree kar ko hataane aur vait ko hataane ka matalab hoga ki poora desh sabhee vyavasaayon ke lie ek star ka khel ban jaega.	Also the removal of Central Sales Tax and the removal of VAT will mean that the entire country will become a level playing ground for all businesses.
enee aur vishesh shrenee ke raajyon ke lie ek vitteey varsh mein 20 laakh rupaye aur kul laakh rupaye tak ke kul kaarobaar vaale karadaataon ko kar se chhoot dee jaegee.	Tax payers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year up to Rs.20 lakhs and Rs.10 Lakhs for NE and special category states would be exempt from tax. 
isake alaava, ek vyakti jisaka poorvavartee vitteey varsh mein kul kaarobaar ru .75 laakh se kam hai, ek saraleekrt rachana yojana ka vikalp chun sakata hai, jahaan raajy mein tarnovar par riyaayatee dar par kar dey hoga.	Further, a person whose aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is less than Rs.75 Lakhs can opt for a simplified composition scheme where tax will payable at a concessional rate on the turnover in a state.
